  - Try not to look in my general direction if you can help it.
  - No you can't buy my top hat. I might have a less stylish one for sale though.
  - Oh, dear, is that dirt on your boots? Truly, the lost lands have no respect for
    decorum.
  - You look like you could use a dash of elegance. Heavy emphasis on the 'could.'
    But worry not, I am here to elevate even the most hopeless cases.
  - "Oh, how quaint\u2014another visitor. Do try not to touch anything unless you
    plan to buy. These hands aren't accustomed to dusting off peasantry."
  - "Ah, another customer. How... expected. Well, let\u2019s make this quick, I have
    more distinguished clientele awaiting my services."
  - Yes, yes, I do have helmets, dear, but they aren't just helmets. They are headwear
    of exceptional taste. Even that football helmet has a certain... rustic charm.
  - I assure you, each piece here has been curated with care. That armet? Impeccable
    for keeping the undead claws away... and quite the conversation starter!
  - "Well, well, here for protection or presentation? It\u2019s all the same to me,
    as long as you can afford it."
  - A head is a terrible thing to waste... fortunately, I have just the solution
    to keep yours intact.
  - "In times like these, standing out isn\u2019t just a luxury; it\u2019s a statement.
    A statement I\u2019m more than equipped to help you make."
  - "Buying, selling, yes, yes, I do it all. But don\u2019t insult me with something
    that\u2019s been through a shredder."
  - Yes, I buy. But not everything that crosses my counter is... worthy. I suggest
    you bring something that can impress.
  - I must warn you, I don't take second-rate goods. Keep your threadbare trash to
    yourself.
  - Give me a hat with a hole, and I might as well give you a shovel to dig a hole
    for yourself!
