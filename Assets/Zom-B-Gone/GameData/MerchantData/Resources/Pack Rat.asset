  - "Hey, hey, hey, you lookin\u2019 for stuff? I got stuff, all kinds of stuff,
    so much stuff I don\u2019t even know what half of it is anymore!"
  - "Look, look, you don\u2019t just throw things away! That\u2019s how you end up
    needing a left-handed sprocket at 3 AM and\u2014oh, wait, I got one right here!"
  - "Oh, you like shiny things? I got shiny things! Dull things, rusty things, things
    that go click-clack, things that might explode\u2014who knows!"
  - "You never know when you\u2019ll need a bent fork, or a half-burned candle, or
    a broken flashlight. "
  - "Need a thingamajig? A whatchamacallit? A doodad? I got \u2018em all! I think.
    Somewhere. Lemme just dig around a bit..."
  - Try not to bump into any of my carefully balanced towers of goods!
  - "Yeah, yeah, I know it looks like junk to you, but every piece has a story, a
    purpose! Well, maybe not that one... but most of \u2018em!"
  - Oh, you need one of those? Yeah, I got one! Or maybe two! Or twenty... you can
    never have too many, right?
  - "You need a left shoe? A right shoe? A shoe that doesn\u2019t fit? I got options!
    No refunds, though... or exchanges... or warranties!"
  - "No, no, no, you can\u2019t have this, it\u2019s my favorite rusty spoon... but
    I do have a bent wrench with your name on it!"
  - "A trade, you say? Oh, I love trades! I\u2019ll give you three broken light bulbs,
    a rubber band, and this mystery jar in exchange for... what do you got?"
  - You say you have junk? I say you have potential!
  - "Hoarding? More like curating! Each piece has its own charm, and I can\u2019t
    wait to see what\u2019s in your collection!"
  - "Oh, I can feel it! Today\u2019s the day for hidden gems! What do you have? A
    broken toy? An old bottle cap? Perfect!"
  - "Let\u2019s get down to business! I\u2019ll take your discarded bits and turn
    them into gold. Literally!!"
  - Time is money, my friend! The faster you show me your stuff, the faster it gets
    added to that huge pile behind me!
  - "Come on, come on! Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got! I\u2019m buzzing with
    excitement! The world\u2019s full of surprises, and I want them all!"
